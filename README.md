Prediction of CO emission on the basis of vehicle components     Details:- Main aim of this project to predict CO emission from the given data which is related to vehicle models and their CO emission. In order to predict CO emission, we need 13 features for more details to run our project. This project will help us to reduce the CO level or to control the CO level in our atmosphere. This Machine Learning model predicts CO emission from the component of the engine, transmission, transmission type, fuel, etc. By using this model we can predict CO emission in an earlier stage of vehicle development with 90% accuracy on unseen data. This model will help vehicle manufacture to gain information regarding their vehicle without running several tests which will reduce the cost of designing as well as R&D. This web application can be also used by National Govt. to make sure no vehicle manufacture is using an engine with a high level of CO emission. Govt. can use this application to predict the CO emission of different vehicle and after that, they can cross-check this by surprise inspection.
